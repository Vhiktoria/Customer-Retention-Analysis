## Insights
- Customers on month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.
- Senior citizens are not likely to churn.
- Customers without internet service rarely churn, while those with fiber optics churn more.
- Customers paying through Electronic Check churn significantly more than other groups, suggesting a need to review user experience or payment convenience for these customers
- Tenure is strongly tied to churn â€” new customers are more likely to leave.

## Conclusion and Recommendations:

### Conclusion
The customer churn analysis revealed clear patterns in user behavior that impact customer retention. Key factors influencing churn include contract type, tenure, payment method, and internet service type. These insights are critical for Telco to understand which customer segments are at higher risk of leaving and what preventive steps can be taken.

### Recommendations

1. **Encourage Long-Term Contracts**  
   Customers on month-to-month plans churn the most. Telco should:
   - Offer attractive incentives for long-term subscriptions.
   - Promote yearly plans with discounts during onboarding.

2. **Investigate Fiber Optic Service Issues**  
   High churn among fiber optic users may indicate service dissatisfaction:
   - Survey fiber users to understand pain points.
   - Improve speed, reliability, or pricing.

3. **Retain New Customers**  
   Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn:
   - Implement early engagement strategies.
   - Offer loyalty rewards or onboarding tutorials within the first 3 months.

4. **Review Electronic Check Payment Experience**  
   Users who pay via electronic checks churn the most:
   - Evaluate the user experience of this payment method.
   - Promote more stable payment options like auto-pay via credit cards or bank transfers.
